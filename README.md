- **Clean, intuitive interface** built with Atlaskit design system

### ðŸ“Š Custom Epic Status Field
- **Later**: Epics planned for future increments
- **Now**: Epics currently being worked on
- **Next**: Epics ready for the upcoming increment

### ðŸš€ Dual View Options

## How to Use

### Managing Epics

3. **Update Status**: Epic status updates are saved automatically
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor epic movement through your workflow

### Working with Increments

1. **Plan Increments**: Use the "Now" column for current increment work
2. **Prepare Next**: Move ready epics to "Next" for upcoming increments
3. **Archive Completed**: Use increment closure to maintain clean boards
4. **Review History**: Access historical increment data for retrospectives

### Best Practices

#### Team Workflow
- **Daily Standups**: Use the board to discuss epic progress

- **Retrospectives**: Review increment closures and epic flow

#### Epic Organization
